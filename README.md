# Mathematical Equation Solver

This Python program can solve a variety of mathematical equations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logarithms, trigonometry, and quadratic equations. It can also calculate the areas of different shapes, such as circles, rectangles, triangles, squares, and parallelograms.

## Version
v2.0

## Features

* Solves a variety of mathematical equations
* Calculates the areas of different shapes
* Easy to use
* Well-organized and modular
* Extensible

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the `ultimatecalculator.py` file. The program will then print a list of the equations and shapes that it can solve. The user can then select the equation or shape they want to solve and then enter the necessary input. The program will then calculate the answer and print it out.

## Example

To calculate the area of a circle, the user would select the "Area of different shapes" option and then enter the radius of the circle. The program would then calculate the area and print it out.
